#how to use
Use `mark.js` in html :
`<script src="mark.js"></script>`
Mark is a global variable that will reactive any subscriber and update that data or render it.

## Template
This will render `Hello World`
```
<div mk="testTmpl"></div>
<template name="testTmpl">Hello World</template>
```
Template like controller-like in mvc. `template` have `name` attribute, that will be a token to render template in a html element with attribute `mk` with same value.

## Text
Simple use `Mark.set('name', 'value');` and render it on `mk-text`
```
    <b mk="coolTmpl"></b>
    <template name="coolTmpl">Hello, <span mk-text="Name"></span></template>
    <script>
        Mark.set('Name', 'Yoza');
    </script>
```
Open your console type `Mark.set('Name', 'Dhika')`, it will update `mk-text="Name"`.

## Input
Input provided by two mark for now, that are `mk-val` and `mk-check`.
```
    <div mk="inputTmpl"></div>
    <template name="inputTmpl">
        <input mk-value="newItem" type="text" />
        <input mk-check="cbx" type="checkbox" />
    </template>
    <script>
        Mark.set('newItem', 'test');
        Mark.set('cbx', true);
    </script>
```
